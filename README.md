## Project description
*All information has been taken from http://skvore.strikingly.com/ for the purpose of web-platform evaluation.*
SKVORE is a non-commercial DIY project aimed at ensuring that people not only enrich their inner world by reading books but also find friends and like-minded people with whom they can discuss what they read. A small free library is nothing more than a small bookcase that anyone can install in the courtyard of their home.
